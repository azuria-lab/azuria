fix: force clean build on Vercel with prebuild script

CRITICAL FIX - Last resort to fix stale builds

Issue:
- Vercel NOT rebuilding despite config changes
- Build cache persisting across deployments
- Users stuck with broken chunks (404 errors)

Root Cause:
- Vercel caching dist/ folder between builds
- No cache invalidation happening
- Stale index-tC7ffidB.js still being served

Solution:
- Add prebuild script to package.json
- Deletes dist/ folder before every build
- Forces complete rebuild from scratch
- Runs automatically before 'npm run build'

Expected Result:
- Fresh dist/ on every Vercel build
- New chunk hashes generated
- Correct files served (index-DuDyYtyH.js, vendor-BCPl9KMR.js)
- Site works for all users

This MUST work.
