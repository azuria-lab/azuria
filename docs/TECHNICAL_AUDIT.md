# 🧪 Technical Audit - Azuria (2025-09-15)

This audit captures the current technical posture of the Azuria project following the rebranding and governance hardening work. Items are grouped by status tiers: **OK**, **Priority**, and **Future**.

---

## ✅ OK (Sound / Maintainable Now)

### Governance & CI

- Branch protection enforced (required checks: lint, type check, smoke tests, build)
- Drift detection workflow for branch protection contexts
- Commit message validation (commitlint) and semantic-release scaffold present
- CodeQL security analysis enabled

### Branding & Configuration

- Centralized branding via `src/config/branding.ts` (product name, domains, API bases, emails, pdf helpers)
- All previously discovered hard‑coded `Precifica` / `Lovable` strings in code replaced or routed through branding
- Service workers & IndexedDB namespaces migrated to Azuria prefixes

### Documentation

- Core docs rebranded (README, USER_GUIDE, API_REFERENCE, DEPLOYMENT, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- Deployment guide lint issues resolved; structured index & environment guidance added

### Testing Strategy

- Separation of smoke vs heavier integration tests (OOM culprit isolated & skipped)
- Lightweight calculator integration retained in smoke suite

### PDF / Export Layer

- All PDF generators use branding helpers (`buildPdfFileName`, `BRANDING.attributionFooter`)

### Security Baseline

- Proprietary license clarified
- Scripts verifying package manager & governance present

## ⚠️ Priority (Address Soon – Risk / Leverage)

| Area | Issue / Gap | Recommendation | Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Test Coverage | No explicit coverage threshold or reporting in CI | Add `vitest --coverage` job + badge; enforce minimum (e.g. 65% -> 75%) | Prevent silent regression |
| Security Headers | No explicit enforcement doc or middleware evidence (SPA host dependent) | Add `SECURITY_HEADERS.md` with sample config + automated curl check in CI | Mitigate XSS / clickjacking |
| SBOM & Supply Chain | SBOM script exists but not uploaded | Workflow: generate & upload `sbom.json` on release tags | Faster vulnerability response |
| Runtime Observability | No error aggregation / tracing | Introduce telemetry wrapper (Sentry/OTel) behind feature flag | Faster prod debugging |
| Rate Limiting Client Resilience | Retry logic only in examples | Central fetch wrapper: exponential backoff + circuit breaker | Consistent resiliency |
| Feature Flags | Prefix reserved but no registry | Add `FEATURE_FLAGS.md` + typed registry file | Avoid drift / dead flags |
| Environment Validation | No startup verification | Implement `validateEnv()` in bootstrap path | Fail fast misconfiguration |
| API Package Names | Legacy namespace references | Document rename plan to `@azuria/*` | Reduce confusion |
| Access Control | Hard-coded admin emails | Externalize to env / branding list & validate | Security & flexibility |
| Marketing Strings in Tests | Some tests assert legacy copy | Replace with branding constant helper | Reduce brittle tests |

## 🔭 Future (Roadmap / Strategic)

### Performance & UX

- Add performance budgets (bundle size, LCP proxy metric) enforced via CI Plugin or custom script.
- Preload critical routes & adopt React.lazy + Suspense boundaries annotated for UX milestones.

### Architecture Evolution

- Consider modular federation or microfrontends only if domain boundaries stabilize (not yet necessary).
- Adopt domain task queues (web workers) for heavy calculations to isolate main thread.

### Security & Compliance

- Automate dependency diff + vulnerability gating (e.g. `npm audit --omit=dev` with severity threshold fail).
- Sign releases & SBOM (Sigstore / cosign) for provenance.

### Analytics / Telemetry

- Introduce unified telemetry adapter (console -> provider) so production adoption is frictionless.
- Event schema versioning file with changelog to avoid analytics drift.

### Developer Experience

- Add a local bootstrap script: checks Node version, installs deps, seeds Supabase test data.
- Pre-commit: add lint-staged markdown formatting (currently empty rule set).

### Internationalization (i18n)

- Provide extraction script & resource bundles (Portuguese baseline) to prep for multi-language expansion.

### Accessibility

- Automated a11y test pass (axe + a small subset of key pages) integrated into CI smoke channel.

### Progressive Delivery

- Define release channels (stable / beta) with environment-based toggles for new risky features.

---

## Suggested Immediate Implementation Order

1. Coverage pipeline + badge
2. Environment validation & admin email externalization
3. Security headers documentation + automated check
4. Central fetch/retry utility
5. SBOM generation/upload in CI
6. Feature flag registry & cleanup script

---

## Fetch Wrapper Sketch (Priority Item 4)

Minimal contract:

- Input: `RequestInfo`, options { retries=3, retryDelay=exponential, circuitBreaker? }
- Output: JSON or typed payload; throws enriched error with response metadata.
- Edge cases: network failure, 429 (retry with backoff), 5xx (limited retries), abort signal, JSON parse fail.

```ts
// src/lib/http/fetchClient.ts (proposed)
export interface FetchOptions extends RequestInit { retries?: number; retryDelayMs?: number; }
export async function resilientFetch(url: string, opts: FetchOptions = {}) { /* ... */ }
```

---

## Metrics to Start Tracking

- Build artifact size (total & main entry)
- Coverage % delta per PR
- Bundle duplication ratio (can integrate with analyzer output)
- Time-to-interactive proxy (lab Lighthouse on PR?)

---

## Summary

Azuria’s foundation is strong post‑rebrand: governance, configuration hygiene, and documentation are in good standing. Focus next on hardening runtime resilience, security headers, and observability to reduce MTTR and future migration friction. The Priority list gives a 2–3 sprint actionable roadmap.
