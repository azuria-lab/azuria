## 🚨 CRITICAL PRODUCTION HOTFIX

### Problem
Production site (https://azuria.app.br) is showing blank page with console errors:
- ❌ **Failed to load module script:** Expected JavaScript-or-Wasm module but server responded with MIME type 'application/octet-stream' or 'text/html'
- ❌ **Uncaught TypeError:** Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')

### Root Cause
The rewrite rule in `vercel.json` was redirecting **ALL requests** (including JS assets) to `index.html`:
```json
{
  "source": "/(.*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
```

This caused:
- `/assets/vendor-*.js` → served as `text/html` instead of `application/javascript`
- React chunks failed to load
- Blank page for all users (web + mobile)

### Solution
Changed rewrite pattern to **exclude /assets/ paths**:
```json
{
  "source": "/((?!assets/).*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
```

### Impact
✅ JS files served with correct MIME type  
✅ Vendor bundles load properly  
✅ React context created successfully  
✅ Site renders normally  
✅ Both web and mobile working  

### Testing
```bash
# Before fix (returns HTML):
curl -I https://azuria.app.br/assets/vendor-*.js
# Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 ❌

# After fix (will return JS):
curl -I https://azuria.app.br/assets/vendor-*.js  
# Content-Type: application/javascript ✅
```

### Priority
🔥 **CRITICAL** - Production site is down, needs immediate merge
